Spot data loaded: 145 rows
Columns: ['Timestamp', 'EURUSD']
First row: {Timestamp: '2025-10-20 09:00:00', EURUSD: 1.1}
```

### Step 3: Upload Simple Test Files

- **Premium:** ~$200,000 (for 100M USD notional)
- **Realized Vol:** ~11% (data generated with ~10% target)
- **P&L:** Should be positive or slightly negative depending on spot path

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Files Not Uploading

**Check Console for Errors:**
```
Error: XLSX library not loaded. Check internet connection.
```
**Solution:** Ensure you have internet connection (CDN libraries need to load)

**Check Console for:**
```
Spot file selected: simple_spot_prices.xlsx
```
**If you DON'T see this:** File input is not working. Try:
1. Click directly on the upload box text
2. Refresh the page
3. Try a different browser
4. Check file permissions

### Issue: "Calculate" Button Not Enabled

**Console should show:**
```
Spot data loaded: 145 rows
Vol data loaded: 3 rows
```

**If missing:** Upload both files again and check console errors

### Issue: Calculation Takes Forever

**Check console for errors during calculation:**
```
Error: Cannot read property 'EURUSD' of undefined
```

**Common causes:**
1. Column names don't match between files
2. Missing 'Timestamp' column in spot file
3. Missing 'Pair', 'Strike', 'Tenor', or 'ImpliedVol' in vol file
4. Data format issues (NaN, null values)

### Issue: Results Look Wrong

**Verify your expectations:**
1. Check CORRECTED_PNL_CALCULATION.md for proper calculation methodology
2. Realized vol should be close to implied vol (~10%)
3. P&L depends on spot path and where volatility occurred
4. Small losses are normal if realized < implied

### Issue: Charts Not Showing

**Check console for:**
```
Error: Chart.js not loaded
```
**Solution:** Ensure internet connection for CDN

**Check for:**
```
Error: Canvas element not found
```
**Solution:** Refresh page, charts might not have initialized

## File Format Verification

### Spot File (simple_spot_prices.xlsx)

**First 3 rows should look like:**
| Timestamp | EURUSD |
|-----------|--------|
| 2025-10-20 09:00:00 | 1.1000 |
| 2025-10-20 09:10:00 | 1.0995 |
| 2025-10-20 09:20:00 | 1.1000 |

**Verify:**
```bash
python -c "import pandas as pd; print(pd.read_excel('simple_spot_prices.xlsx').head())"
```

### Vol File (simple_implied_vols.xlsx)

**All rows should look like:**
| Pair | Strike | Tenor | ImpliedVol |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| EURUSD | ATM | 1D | 10.0 |
| EURUSD | 25DP | 1D | 11.5 |
| EURUSD | 25DC | 1D | 10.5 |

**Verify:**
```bash
python -c "import pandas as pd; print(pd.read_excel('simple_implied_vols.xlsx'))"
```

## Alternative: Use CSV Files

If Excel files aren't working, try CSV versions:

1. **simple_spot_prices.csv** - Same data, CSV format
2. **simple_implied_vols.csv** - Same data, CSV format

**Note:** You may need to update the HTML to accept .csv files. Currently it's configured for .xlsx primarily.

## Next Steps After Successful Test

1. âœ… Verify calculations match expected results
2. âœ… Test with multiple currency pairs (sample_spot_prices.xlsx)
3. âœ… Test different hedge frequencies (30 min, 1 hour)
4. âœ… Test different strikes (25DP, 25DC)
5. âœ… Export results and analyze in Excel
6. âœ… Prepare your own data following the same format

## Getting Help

**If tests fail:**
1. Copy full console output
2. Note which step failed
3. Check CORRECTED_PNL_CALCULATION.md for expected results
4. Verify file formats exactly match specifications

**Common fixes:**
- Refresh page and try again
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Verify internet connection (for CDN libraries)
- Check file formats match specifications
- Use simple test files first before complex data

## Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
âœ… Both upload boxes are green
âœ… Calculate button is enabled
âœ… Results appear within seconds
âœ… Summary cards show statistics
âœ… P&L table has rows of data
