# FX Volatility Trading Analytics System

## Overview

A web-based analytics tool for calculating P&L from **buying** FX options and delta-hedging them. This tool helps you determine which options are actually profitable to buy, accounting for where volatility occurs relative to the strike (gamma effect), path dependency, and actual hedging cashflows.

## Key Features

‚úÖ **P&L-Focused Analysis** - Primary metric for trading decisions
‚úÖ **Zero Interest Rate** - Simplified for short-dated options (r=0)
‚úÖ **Standardized Notionals** - 100 million USD equivalent across all pairs
‚úÖ **Black-Scholes Pricing** - With proper delta calculations
‚úÖ **Delta-Hedging Simulation** - Configurable frequency (10min to 6h)
‚úÖ **Interactive Charts** - Click any P&L cell to see evolution
‚úÖ **Excel Export** - Detailed results and P&L paths
‚úÖ **Multi-Currency Support** - Handles USD pairs and crosses

#### File 2: Implied Volatility Data (`sample_implied_vols.xlsx` format)

| Pair | Strike | Tenor | ImpliedVol |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| EURUSD | ATM | 1D | 11.30 |
| EURUSD | 25DP | 1D | 12.15 |
| EURUSD | 25DC | 1D | 11.91 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 3. Upload and Configure

   - Click "Upload Spot Price Data" and select your spot file
   - Click "Upload Implied Volatility Data" and select your vol file
   - Both boxes will turn green when files are loaded ‚úì

## Understanding the Results

### Tab 1: P&L Analysis (PRIMARY)

This is your main view showing actual trading profitability.

**Summary Cards:**
- **Total P&L**: Aggregate P&L across all analyzed trades
- **Average P&L per Trade**: Mean performance
- **Profitable Trades**: Win rate (X out of Y trades)
- **Avg Realized Vol**: Average volatility actually experienced

**P&L Table:**
Shows each trade with breakdown:
- **Premium Paid**: Initial cost of buying the option
- **Hedge P&L**: Cumulative profit/loss from delta hedging
- **Intrinsic Value**: Final payoff at expiry
- **Total P&L**: = -Premium + Hedge P&L + Intrinsic Value

**Interactive Feature:** Click any row to see P&L evolution over time!

### Tab 2: Volatility Comparison (SECONDARY)

Shows realized vs implied volatility scatter plot.

**Key Insight:**
- Points above the diagonal: Realized > Implied (volatility higher than expected)
- Green points: Profitable trades
- Red points: Losing trades

**Important:** High realized vol doesn't guarantee profit! If spot moves away from strike (low gamma region), you can have high vol but negative P&L.

### Tab 3: P&L Rankings

Shows:
- **Top 5 Profitable Trades**: Best performers
- **Bottom 5 Trades**: Worst performers

Use this to identify:
- Which currency pairs are most profitable
- Which strikes/tenors work best
- Divergences where realized > implied but P&L is negative

## Key Calculations Explained

### P&L at Any Time t (Before Expiry)

```
P&L(t) = -Premium_paid + Cumulative_hedge_PL(t) + Option_MTM(t)

where:
  Option_MTM(t) = Current Black-Scholes value at time t
```

### P&L at Expiry

```
P&L(T) = -Premium_paid + Cumulative_hedge_PL(T) + Intrinsic_value

where:
  Intrinsic_value = max(S_T - K, 0) for calls
  Intrinsic_value = max(K - S_T, 0) for puts
```

### Delta-Hedging P&L

At each rehedge point:
```
Hedge_PL = -Delta_position √ó (Spot_new - Spot_old)

where:
  Delta_position = N(d1) √ó Base_notional (for calls)
  Delta_position = [N(d1) - 1] √ó Base_notional (for puts)
```

### Realized Volatility

```
1. Calculate log returns: r_i = ln(S_i / S_{i-1})
2. Calculate variance: var = Œ£(r_i¬≤) / n
3. Annualize: realized_vol = ‚àö(var √ó periods_per_year)

where:
  periods_per_year = (365 √ó 24 √ó 60) / frequency_minutes
```

### Notional Handling

All trades normalized to **100 million USD equivalent**:

- **EURUSD** (quote = USD): 100 mio USD notional ‚Üí ~90.91 mio EUR at spot 1.1000
- **USDJPY** (base = USD): 100 mio USD notional ‚Üí 15 billion JPY at spot 150.00
- **AUDCHF** (cross): 100 mio CHF notional ‚Üí ~143 mio AUD at spot 0.7000

P&L presented as unitless for cross-pair comparison.

## Configuration Options Explained

### Hedge Frequency

Controls how often you rebalance your delta hedge:

- **10 minutes**: Most frequent, captures gamma better, more transaction costs
- **30 minutes**: Balanced approach
- **1 hour**: Less frequent, lower transaction costs
- **6 hours**: Infrequent, mainly for testing concepts

**Recommendation:** Start with 10 minutes for short-dated options (1D), 30 minutes for longer (1W).

### Option Type

- **Call**: Profit from upward moves
- **Put**: Profit from downward moves
- **Both**: Analyze calls and puts simultaneously

### Strikes

- **ATM (At-The-Money)**: Strike = Current spot
- **25DP (25-Delta Put)**: Strike below spot, delta ‚âà -0.25
- **25DC (25-Delta Call)**: Strike above spot, delta ‚âà 0.25
- **10DP/10DC**: Further out-of-the-money

**Trading Insight:** ATM options have highest gamma (sensitivity to spot changes). OTM options are cheaper but need larger moves to profit.

## Interpreting Results: Key Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Realized Vol, Positive P&L ‚úÖ
```
Realized Vol > Implied Vol AND Total P&L > 0
```
**Meaning:** Volatility was higher than expected AND spot oscillated near the strike (high gamma region). This is the ideal outcome for option buying.

**Example:** Bought ATM call at 1.1000, spot oscillated between 1.0980-1.1020, generating hedge profits.

### Scenario 2: High Realized Vol, Negative P&L ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
Realized Vol > Implied Vol BUT Total P&L < 0
```
**Meaning:** Volatility was high, but spot moved away from strike (low gamma). Hedging costs exceeded option value.

**Example:** Bought ATM call at 1.1000, spot quickly moved to 1.0900 and stayed there. High volatility far from strike = poor gamma = loss.

### Scenario 3: Low Realized Vol, Positive P&L üí°
```
Realized Vol < Implied Vol BUT Total P&L > 0
```
**Meaning:** Volatility was lower than expected, but the option ended deep in-the-money (ITM).

**Example:** Bought ATM call at 1.1000, implied 10%, spot drifted to 1.1100 with low vol. Intrinsic value exceeded premium paid.

### Scenario 4: Low Realized Vol, Negative P&L ‚ùå
```
Realized Vol < Implied Vol AND Total P&L < 0
```
**Meaning:** Volatility was low and spot didn't move enough. Paid too much premium for little movement.

**Example:** Bought ATM call at 1.1000, spot stayed around 1.1005. Premium lost due to time decay.

## Best Practices

### Data Quality

1. **Clean Monday Data**: Bloomberg FX data is unreliable until 5 PM NY on Monday. Filter or adjust Monday morning data.

2. **Weekend Scaling**: Friday implied vols cover 3 days (Fri-Mon) but spot market is closed. Consider scaling vols appropriately.

3. **Check for Gaps**: Ensure no missing timestamps in spot data. Fill gaps with forward-fill or interpolation.

### Analysis Workflow

1. **Start Small**: Test with 1-2 currency pairs and 24 hours of data first
2. **Validate**: Compare results against known market behavior
3. **Iterate**: Adjust hedge frequency and strikes based on results
4. **Export**: Save detailed results to Excel for further analysis

### Trading Insights

1. **P&L is King**: Don't just compare realized vs implied vol. P&L tells the full story.

2. **Gamma Matters**: Options with high gamma (near ATM, short-dated) are most sensitive to spot oscillations.

3. **Path Dependency**: Two trades can have same realized vol but different P&L based on timing of moves.

4. **Strike Selection**: ATM strikes have highest gamma but cost more premium. OTM strikes are cheaper but need larger moves.

## Technical Details

### Black-Scholes Implementation

Using simplified Black-Scholes with:
- **r = 0** (zero interest rate for short-dated options)
- **q = 0** (no dividend yield for currencies)

Call option:
```
d1 = [ln(S/K) + 0.5œÉ¬≤T] / (œÉ‚àöT)
d2 = d1 - œÉ‚àöT
Price = S √ó N(d1) - K √ó N(d2)
Delta = N(d1)
```

Put option:
```
Price = K √ó N(-d2) - S √ó N(-d1)
Delta = N(d1) - 1
```

### Performance

- Handles up to 30 currency pairs simultaneously
- Processes 1 week of 10-minute data (~1,000 points) in seconds
- Browser-based calculation (no server required)
- Results cached for instant re-export

## Summary: Why P&L Matters

**Traditional Approach:**
> "Realized vol was 20% vs 10% implied, so buying options was profitable."

**Reality Check:**
> "Realized vol was 20% but spot moved away from strike (low gamma), so hedging costs exceeded option value. P&L was -$50,000."

**This Tool Shows:**
- ‚úÖ Where volatility occurred (near or far from strike)
- ‚úÖ How gamma affected hedge costs
- ‚úÖ Path dependency of P&L
- ‚úÖ Actual trading profitability

**Bottom Line:** Use P&L as your primary decision metric. Volatility comparison is useful context, but P&L is what matters for trading.
